# Edu-Server-Client-Applicaiton
Implemented a multi-threaded Edu-Server and Client application in C, using POSIX APIs such that they can be easily ported to other POSIX compliant operating systems. Used semaphores to protect the data while they are being accessed by the Server thread and the periodic report generator thread.
